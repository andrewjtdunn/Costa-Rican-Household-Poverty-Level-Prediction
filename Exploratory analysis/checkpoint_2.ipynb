            "The KNN approach suffered from some issues we were not able to address, leading us to conclude this was not the right model. KNN uses all features by default, but our attempts at selecting only certain features was if anything less successful than using all features. Likewise, an attempt to break out 4 from the rest and then classify the rest between 1,2,3 did worse than a one stage classifier. Finally, when we tried to oversample our classes 1-3, the KNN model continued to predict only class 4. While we will continue to use some of these approaches to better classify our data, it is clear to us that KNN does not provide the best path forwards."

            "\n",
            "The goal of logistic regression is to find the best parameters of a logistic function that minimizes the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual outcomes. The logistic function uses the sigmoid function, which maps any real number into a range between 0 and 1, allowing us to interpret the output as a probability. The input features are weighted and combined linearly, and the resulting value is passed through the logistic function to produce a probability. We then use gradient descent to determine what the best classification is for these categories. Regularization helps to improve the generalization performance of the model by balancing the bias-variance trade-off and reducing overfitting.  By penalizing the weights of the input features, regularization encourages the model to focus on the most important features that are most relevant to the target variable. Overfitting occurs when a model learns to fit the training data too closely, including noise and irrelevant features, leading to poor generalization performance on new, unseen data. In this case we will try L2 regularization which adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the weights.\n",
            "\n",
            "One drawback however, is that it assumes linear relationships which based on the diversity of our data, may not be true in this case. "
